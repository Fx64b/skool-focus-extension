# Skool Focus Extension - Firefox Version
Due to some limitations in Firefox Manifest V3 implementation (for example the lacking support of background.service_worker)
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573659

I created a separate version of the extension for Firefox. It should have the same features as the Chrome version, but it is not tested as much as the Chrome version.

> **IMPORTANT**
> At the moment pretty much nothing works in the Firefox Version for reasons I haven't found yet. Check the progress at: https://github.com/Fx64b/skool-focus-extension/issues/7
